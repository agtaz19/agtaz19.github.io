                        <p>
                            I am currently an Officer in State Street’s Alternative Investments Transformation group, where I focus on managing and optimizing the intersection of people, processes, and technology across private equity, hedge funds, and other alternative investment platforms. In this role, I work closely with internal and external stakeholders to analyze, design, and implement operational improvements that enhance efficiency, reduce risk, and support scalable, client-facing solutions. My responsibilities span the full spectrum of transformation work: identifying and deploying process improvements, gathering and interpreting end-user requirements, collaborating with internal developers to deliver tailored solutions, and leading workshops to communicate complex operational models to diverse teams. The role requires balancing multiple priorities, applying creative problem-solving to complex operational challenges, and driving meaningful outcomes under tight timelines—all while ensuring compliance with regulatory and internal policy frameworks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alongside my professional work, I am pursuing advanced mathematics studies at Baruch College. My coursework focuses on probability, statistics, linear algebra, and computer science, motivated by the goal of strengthening my quantitative and analytical foundation to inform systematic investment strategies, financial modeling, and data-driven decision-making. These studies complement my professional work by providing a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding risk, constructing models, and interpreting complex financial data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, I am actively involved with the Financial Quants and Engineers (FQE) community, where I collaborate with peers on quantitative finance projects, algorithmic trading research, and computational finance initiatives. This engagement allows me to apply mathematical concepts to practical financial problems, exchange ideas with fellow enthusiasts, and explore emerging methodologies in quantitative research. Collectively, my professional, academic, and extracurricular endeavors reflect a commitment to continuous learning, technical rigor, and translating theory into actionable solutions in the alternative investments space.

                        <h3>
                            Previous Experiences
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Prior to my current role, I was a consultant at FTI Consulting within the Corporate Finance & Restructuring practice. There, I advised clients on performance improvement, restructuring initiatives, and transaction-related projects, contributing to over $55 million in identified and implemented cost savings. In addition to client work, I participated in recruiting, new-hire onboarding and training, and internal initiatives focused on diversity and inclusion, which honed both my leadership and organizational skills in high-pressure, results-driven environments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research under <a class="text-primary" href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/825492">Professor Sunil Wahal</a> on <i>R&D, Expected Profitability, and Expected Returns</i>, (Goyal, Wahal - 2023). In this project, I analyzed how corporate R&D expenditures predict future cash-based operating profitability and the implications for expected stock returns. My work involved gathering and cleaning firm-level financial and R&D data, constructing operating profitability factors, and implementing regression analyses to examine relationships between R&D intensity and expected returns. Through this research, I helped confirm that high R&D firms exhibit positive loadings on a cash-based operating profitability factor while showing zero alphas, and demonstrated that capitalizing R&D into book values is unnecessary for asset pricing when expected profitability is explicitly incorporated. This experience honed my quantitative modeling skills, empirical research methodology, and ability to translate complex financial concepts into actionable insights.
                        </p>                    

                        <p>
                            Earlier in my career, I gained experience in private equity, venture capital, and corporate strategy. At Transcend Healthcare Partners (middle market PE) and Anodize Capital Partners (search fund), I supported investment evaluation, due diligence, financial modeling, and portfolio company initiatives. I also contributed to strategy and growth projects in autonomous vehicles at Intel, providing go-to-market analysis and operational recommendations in a dynamic technology environment.

                        <p>
                            I have additional experience in estate planning and business law as a legal assistant.

                            Academic Background
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            I hold a dual degree in Finance and Supply Chain Management from Arizona State University, where I graduated summa cum laude and was recognized as a Jack D. Furst Honors Scholar (2022). My academic training provided a rigorous foundation in both financial theory and operational strategy. In finance, I developed expertise in financial analysis, valuation, capital markets, portfolio management, and corporate finance, gaining experience with tools such as LBO, DCF, Comparable Company, and Precedent Transaction analyses. In supply chain management, I focused on process optimization, logistics, operations strategy, and sustainable practices, learning to integrate quantitative methods with strategic decision-making to improve organizational efficiency and resilience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Concurrently, I was actively engaged with the Student Investment Management Fund & Portfolio Engineering under <a class="text-primary" href="https://swahal.github.io/">Professor Sunil Wahal</a> and <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.boguth.org/">Professor Oliver Boguth</a>, analyzing retail investor activity and implementing methodologies inspired by Tracking Retail Investor Activity (Ekkehart Boehmer et al.), evaluating the predictive power of retail order imbalances for short-term equity performance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also completed my honors thesis under <a class="text-primary" href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/192622">Professor Mark Simonson</a>, producing a comprehensive valuation and pitchbook of Footlocker, Inc., employing LBO, DCF, Comparable Company, and Precedent Transaction analyses.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I further strengthened my practical skills and competitive edge through participation in multiple case competitions. Notably, I earned second place in the Dell Case Competition for sustainable supply chain management, demonstrating my ability to apply analytical frameworks and strategic insights to real-world operational challenges. Additional competitions provided exposure to corporate strategy, financial modeling, and cross-functional teamwork, reinforcing both my technical capabilities and leadership skills.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Collectively, my education combined rigorous theoretical training, applied research, and practical investment and operational experience, equipping me to approach complex business and financial problems with analytical precision, strategic insight, and creativity.

                        <p>
                            I spent two years at Case Western Reserve University studying Cognitive Science and English, minoring in Computer Science.
